/*      For example, given:

        X = 10
        Y = 85
        D = 30
        the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

        after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
        after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
        after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
        Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
        X â‰¤ Y.*/
